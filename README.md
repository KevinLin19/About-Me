# Hi, I'm Kevin 👋

AI Engineer specialized in efficient and deployable intelligent systems.

I design and optimize deep learning models for real-world applications, with a strong focus on model compression, low-latency inference, and multimodal AI.

## What I Build

• Multimodal AI systems (text + image)
• Model compression for embedded environments
• LLM integration and RAG pipelines
• Multi-agent architectures
• Efficient inference systems

## Featured Projects

🔹 Invoice Automation AI
AI-based OCR and classification system for business document processing.

🔹 Multimodal Chatbot System  
Integration of image understanding into a production chatbot.

🔹 Model Compression Research  
Pruning and optimization of large-scale models for constrained deployment.
